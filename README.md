# nodemailer

Nodemailer Application **Backend Only** for testing and reference purposes only. 
<ul>
  <li>This uses the Express web application framework</li>
  <li>Express-Handlebars as a Templating Engine</li>
  <li>Body-Parser to parse incoming request bodies</li>
  <li>Nodemailer, a module for Node.js that makes handling emails a breeze!</li>
</ul>

If you have a contact form that you'd like to set up, I highly recommend Nodemailer as it is an easy-to-use and quick solution 
for those who may otherwise not have knowledge of back end development.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
